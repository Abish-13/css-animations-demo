# CSS Animations Showcase

A simple webpage demonstrating various CSS animation techniques, built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

## Features Demonstrated
-   **Animation on Load:** Elements that animate into view as the page loads using `@keyframes`.
-   **Animation on Hover:** Interactive cards that scale and change shadow on mouse hover, using the `transition` property.
-   **Animation on Click:** A modal window that appears and disappears with a smooth transition, triggered by JavaScript click events.
