# CSS Animations & Transitions Showcase

This project is a demonstration of proficiency in creating dynamic and interactive user interfaces using modern CSS techniques. It showcases a variety of animation types, from simple hover transitions to more complex, event-driven effects, all built from scratch with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

## ‚ú® Key Features & Skills Demonstrated

-   **Hover-Triggered Transitions:** Implemented smooth `transition` effects on UI elements to provide intuitive visual feedback on user interaction. This demonstrates a core principle of good UI/UX design.

-   **Keyframe Animations:** Utilized `@keyframes` to create multi-step animations that run on page load, showcasing an understanding of more complex animation control.

-   **Click-Triggered Animations:** Engineered a modal window that appears and disappears based on user clicks. This was achieved by using JavaScript event listeners to toggle CSS classes, demonstrating the ability to combine JS logic with CSS transitions for interactive functionality.

-   **DOM Manipulation:** Used vanilla JavaScript to select and manipulate HTML elements to control the application's state (e.g., opening/closing the modal).

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

-   **HTML5:** For the semantic structure of the elements.
-   **CSS3:** For all styling and animations, including:
    -   `transition`
    -   `transform`
    -   `@keyframes`
-   **JavaScript (ES6):** For handling DOM manipulation and click events.
